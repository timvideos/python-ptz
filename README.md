# python-ptz
Library for interfacing with PTZ cameras.

# Plans

Current planned support is for the [cameras in Tim's spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_thcxt4IhPswIQrtRejGuzMgHnP04VAe19cn0MqEK1Q/edit#gid=804238177). They are;

 * Panasonic HE100 camera (based of code in https://github.com/timvideos/panacontrol)
 * Sony EVI-D30 Color PTZ
 * Canon VC-C50i Color PTZ
 
## Tools

 * circles - Test program which makes the camera go around in circles.
 * gamepad-control - Program which lets you control the PTZ camera with a gamepad such as a Sony Playstation or Microsoft Xbox controller.
 * speakertrack - Program which uses gstreamer and OpenCV to track a speaker giving a presentation. Based off Tim's idea in gst-switch.
